#### Binary Classification of MBTI Personality Types Based on Korean Text Data

### Abstract: We conduct binary classification of personality types based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) using a large corpus of natural language data present in the media. To align with the research objectives, we utilize natural language data extracted from MBTI caf√© posts on the Naver portal site to construct the dataset. Subsequently, after preprocessing and refining the data, we perform the embedding process on the cleaned natural language data. Following that, we optimize the classification performance through modeling using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and various machine learning models.
